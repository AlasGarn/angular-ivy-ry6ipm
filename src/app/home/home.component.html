            I am fascinated by how life is based around complex structures and mechanisms that emerge from the collective motion of atoms. As a researcher, I try to solve biological problems to answer questions about the function of molecular machines and how diseases arise from their malfunction.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the past eight years, I have used computational models, spanning the spectrum from quantum mechanics to coarse-grained molecular dynamics, with the help of Markov state models and enhanced sampling techniques to describe complex biomolecular systems in great detail. My work has taken me into a range of fascinating areas, including transcription with RNA polymerase II and antibody design, among others.

          <p>
            Currently, I am a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, working alongside Xuhui Huang. 
            Through my work I hope to advance our understanding of the way life works and help people suffering from diseases.

      <h2>Mutations in PP2A hack its allosteric network</h2>
      <p>
      Mutations in the protein phosphatase 2A, a major cell cycle regulator, 
      cause cancer and intellectual disability. 
      I found that mutations in this protein rewire a communication network 
      underlying its dynamics to exert their harmful effect.

      <h2>It takes more than one hydrogen bond to stop a transcribing RNA polymerase II</h2>
      <p>
The RNA polymerase II transcribes almost all protein coding genes in eukaryotes and is very sensitive to modifications of the DNA. 
By using Markov state models, I found that 5-carboxylcytosine - an epigenetic modification of cytosine - can stop the Pol II by interfering with its internal machinery in suprizingly many ways. <a href="https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(21)00524-X/fulltext" target="_blank">Read more in JBC...</a>
